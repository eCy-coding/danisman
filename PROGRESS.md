# PROGRESS — Perspektifler rebuild decision log

Spec: `~/Desktop/istek.md` v2 · Plan: approved 2026-06-11 · Branch: `claude/cranky-bassi-9bd8b1`

## Gate-0 (in progress)
**Done:** premise validation (3 false premises in v1 corrected — see istek.md v2 §CHANGELOG); istek.md v2 written; SCOPE.md + allowlist + scope_guard.py hook created; OUT_OF_SCOPE.md seeded.
**Decisions:** Option B architecture (evolve live /blog, harvest+delete mock prototype); zero-dep Turkish-folded search; benchmark phase replaced by encoded consensus; CSS-only motion (no WebGL).
**Next:** tasks JSON · CLAUDE.md contract section · content inventory CSV · baseline runs (typecheck/unit/e2e smoke).

**Blocked (owner action needed):** wiring `scope_guard.py` into `.claude/settings.json` was denied by the permission classifier (agent may not modify its own permission machinery). The hook script is tested (block=2/allow=0). Owner can activate by adding to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"hooks": {
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit|NotebookEdit",
      "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python3 \"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/hooks/scope_guard.py\"" }]
    }
  ]
}
```
Until then the fence is enforced procedurally (SCOPE.md discipline).
